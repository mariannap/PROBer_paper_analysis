### <a name="pre" />Prerequisites

This snakemake workflow is tested and intended to run under Ubuntu Linux 64 bit architecture. Please make sure that your server has at least 20 cores and 32G memory.

First, you need to install the latest version of [Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home). 

Second, please make sure that you have `Perl`, `Python` and `R`(>= 3.3.0) installed. For `Python`, we additionally require the following packages: `Cython`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pysam`, `requests`, and `statsmodels`. For `R`, please install packages `reshape2`, `PRROC`, and `RNAprobR`.

The snippet below shows how to install `Snakemake` and required packages under `virtualenv`.

```
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip3 install snakemake
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install Cython
pip3 install pysam
pip3 install requests
pip3 install statsmodels

R
>install.packages("reshape2")
>install.packages("PRROC")
>source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
>biocLite("RNAprobR")
>q()
```

### <a name="reproduce" />Reproduce analyses

#### <a name="clone" />Clone the workflow

Type 

```
git clone git@github.com:pachterlab/PROBer_paper_analysis.git work_dir
```

to clone PROBer paper analysis workflow to your working directory. `work_dir` refers to the working directory you choose (e.g. 'PROBer_paper_analysis').

#### <a name="snakemake" />Run snakemake

Activate your environment (if you use `virtualenv`) and go to `work_dir`:

```
source venv/bin/activate
cd work_dir
```

Then type 

```
snakemake -j <number_of_threads>
```

`<number_of_threads>` is the total number of threads you want to use. This number should be no less than 20. 

#### <a name="results" />Results

You can find all figures and tables under `results`.

##### <a name="figures" />Figures

Mappings between figure names in our draft and file names under `results` are shown in the table below:

##### <a name="bedgraph" />BedGraph files

`NUP133.bedGraph` shows the RBFOX2 iCLIP hits on gene `NUP133`. To visualize it, following the instructions below:

1. Go to https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38
2. Click "add custom tracks"
3. Click "Choose file" at "Paste URLs or data:         Or upload:", and upload one bedGraph file
4. Click "Submit"
5. Click "go" at the right side of "view in Genome Browser"
